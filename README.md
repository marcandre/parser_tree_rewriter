# ParserTreeRewriter

Use the upcoming `Parser::Source::TreeRewriter` with the current `parser` 2.4.0.2

All this code will be in all future releases of `parser` (so this gem won't do anything in that case)

## Installation

You know the drill. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'parser_tree_rewriter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install parser_tree_rewriter

## Usage

See the doc for `Parser::Source::TreeRewriter`

## Development / Contributing

This gem is meant to be final.
